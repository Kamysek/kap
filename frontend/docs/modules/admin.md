This module provides all the routes and components needed for the different administration views in the app.  
Mainly these are:

- `appointments`: The main planning and management overview for appointments and the respective components
- `users`: The list of users with options to change their data and add new users
- `plan`: The Study Plan and options to change it
- `overdue`: A list of currently overdue patients

Also in the `resolvers` folder there are services to load the required data for views in the admin module
