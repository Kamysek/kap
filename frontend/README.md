## Local Setup

Make sure to have installed yarn on your machine! To do so, follow the instructions at [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)  
Install all dependencies by running `yarn install` in this directory.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The Django backend is expected to serve `/graphql` at `localhost:8000`!
